            "Complex systems are systems whose behaviour is intrinsically difficult to model due to the
            dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other interactions between their parts or between a given
            system and its environment." Biology is packed with complex systems which are often challenging to
            comprehend. Genetta represents genetic designs as networks. This representation allows analysis and
            transformations to be applied to tailor visualisation based on requirements.

            Genetta uses a neo4j server to store a graph containing multiple graphs where one of
            these may pertain to a design. Encoding designs as networks enable the data to be transformed
            into more comprehensible structures by different users. Tailored views allow connections to be made that
            may not be immediately apparent.

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>All sub-tools can be accessed from the toolbar above.</p>
    <div class="col-6">
        <h4>Graph Admin</h4>
        <p>The section for more administrative functions on the
            graph, such as adding and removing data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
        <h4>Visualiser</h4>
        <p>A tool purely for a visualisation tool and allows for
            many automated and manual changes to the representation. Note this may be very slow with large
            graphs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
        <h4>Editor</h4>
        <p>A tool which visualises designs but also allows manual
            editing of the design. Editing can be done on views which are propogated back into the original dataset.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
        <h4>Database</h4>
        <p>A tool which visualises the underlying network
            representation of several
            existing unified databases to present this information as a single entity.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>GENETTA is academic software and therefore is built with limited resources. While we are activley expanding
        and
        maintaining this tool, we do not have the resources for complete testing. Therefore, any issues found please
        report here: <a href="https://github.com/Biocomputation-CBGP/genetta-frontend">GitHub</a>. Furthermore if
        you
        would like to
        contribute or would like to use a sub-tool in your pipeline please email: <a
