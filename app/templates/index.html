                "Complex systems are systems whose behaviour is intrinsically difficult to model due to the
                dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other interactions between their parts or between a given
                system and its environment." Biology is packed with complex systems which are often challenging to
                comprehend. Genet represents genetic designs as networks. This representation allows analysis and
                transformations to be applied to tailor visualisation based on requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Genet uses a neo4j server to store a graph containing multiple graphs where one of
                these may pertain to a design. Encoding designs as networks enable the data to be transformed
                into more comprehensible structures by different users. Tailored views allow connections to be made that
                may not be immediately apparent.

            <h4>FEATURES</h4>
            All sub-tools can be accessed from the toolbar above.
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Graph Admin</b> - The section for more administrative functions on the
                    graph, such as adding and removing data.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Visualiser</b> - A tool purely for a visualisation tool and allows for
                    many automated and manual changes to the representation. Note this may be very slow with large
                    graphs.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Editor</b> - A tool which visualises designs but also allows manual
                    editing of the design.
                    Editing can be done on views which are propogated back into the original dataset. </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Database</b> - A tool which visualises the underlying network
                    representation of several
                    existing unified databases to present this information as a single entity.

        <h4>ABOUT</h4>
        <p>GENET is academic software and therefore is built with limited resources. While we are activley expanding and
            maintaining this tool, we do not have the resources for complete testing. Therefore, any issues found please
            report here: <a href="https://github.com/MattyCrowther/genet2">GitHub</a>. Furthermore if you would like to
            contribute or would like to use a sub-tool in your pipeline please email: <a
